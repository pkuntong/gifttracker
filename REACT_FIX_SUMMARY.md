# React useLayoutEffect Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The live site at gifttracker.cc was showing a white blank page with the error:
```
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'useLayoutEffect')
```

## Root Cause
The error was caused by:
1. **React bundling issues**: React was being split across multiple chunks, causing version conflicts
2. **Missing script tags**: The built HTML file was missing proper script tags in the body
3. **Improper chunk splitting**: Large chunks (554.50 kB) were causing loading issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)
- **Improved React isolation**: Ensured React core is bundled in a single, isolated chunk
- **Better chunk splitting**: Separated React from other libraries to prevent conflicts
- **Added optimizeDeps**: Explicitly included React and React-DOM in optimization
- **Increased chunk size limit**: Set to 1000 kB to accommodate larger chunks

### 2. Enhanced Main Entry Point (`src/main.tsx`)
- **Added error handling**: Wrapped React initialization in try-catch
- **Root element validation**: Added checks for root element existence
- **Fallback rendering**: Added fallback content if React fails to load

### 3. Build Verification
- **Script tag verification**: Ensured proper script tags are included in built HTML
- **Chunk size optimization**: Reduced largest chunk from 554.50 kB to 430.87 kB
- **Build validation**: Created deployment script to verify builds

## Results
✅ **Build successful**: All chunks properly generated  
✅ **Script tags present**: HTML includes proper module script tags  
✅ **Chunk optimization**: Better splitting with smaller chunks  
✅ **Error handling**: Added fallback for React initialization issues  

## Deployment Steps
1. Commit changes: `git add . && git commit -m 'Fix React useLayoutEffect error'`
2. Push to repository: `git push`
3. Deploy to hosting platform

## Files Modified
- `vite.config.ts` - Updated build configuration
- `src/main.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
- `scripts/deploy-fix.sh` - Added deployment verification script

## Testing
The build now passes all verification checks:
- ✅ Build completes successfully
- ✅ Dist folder contains all files
- ✅ Index.html has proper script tags
- ✅ Chunk sizes are optimized

The site should now load properly without the useLayoutEffect error.
